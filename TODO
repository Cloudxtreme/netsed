--- TODO and wishlist in no particular order:
- Find a better bugtracker than this file
- tests basic features
- test transparent proxy mode again
- doc that udp does not work
- implement udp
- implementing all sed scripting is not the plan, but 
  - implement some regex support (most of sed s// command without all the scripting that sed allows). man 3 regex
  - allowing the rule to be processed externally by a filter program (so the real sed can be used). check with popen.
- catch ^C (SIGINT) and close sockets cleanly (could help tests)
